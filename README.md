# Expense Tracker Web Application

## Overview
A lightweight, browser-based expense tracking application that allows users to manage and visualize their expenses. The application stores data locally and provides interactive charts for expense analysis.

## How It Works
The application follows a simple MVC-like architecture where:
- Data is stored in the browser's localStorage
- UI updates are handled through DOM manipulation
- Charts are rendered using Chart.js
- Styling is managed through CSS with Bootstrap integration

## Key Features
- Add expenses with amount, category, and date
- View total expenses and category-wise breakdown
- Interactive expense list with delete functionality
- Date range filtering for expense analysis
- Visual representation of expenses using charts
- Persistent storage using localStorage
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Styling**: Bootstrap 5.3.0
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage
- **CSS Variables**: Custom theming support
